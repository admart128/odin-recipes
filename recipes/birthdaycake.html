        <li>4 large eggs, room temperature</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup rainbow sprinkles</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>For the frosting:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>5 cups powdered sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup whole milk</li>
        <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
        <li>Additional rainbow sprinkles for decoration</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Instructions:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350Â°F (175Â°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, cream the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the flour mixture to the butter mixture, alternating with the milk, beginning and ending with the flour mixture. Mix until just combined. Gently fold in the rainbow sprinkles.</li>
        <li>Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans. Smooth the tops with a spatula.</li>
        <li>Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of each cake comes out clean. Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes before transferring them to wire racks to cool completely.</li>
        <li>While the cakes are cooling, prepare the frosting: In a large bowl, beat the softened butter until creamy. Gradually add the powdered sugar, milk, vanilla extract, and salt. Beat until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Once the cakes have cooled, place one cake layer on a serving plate. Spread a generous layer of frosting on top, then add the second cake layer. Frost the top and sides of the cake with the remaining frosting. Decorate the cake with additional rainbow sprinkles as desired.</li>
        <li>Store the finished cake in an airtight container or under a cake dome at room temperature. Enjoy your festive Birthday Cake with family and friends!</li>
