  <li>Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Cook lasagna noodles according to package instructions, then drain and set aside.</li>
  <li>In a large skillet, cook ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until beef is browned. Stir in marinara sauce, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
  <li>In a medium bowl, combine ricotta cheese and egg. Mix well.</li>
  <li>Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange a layer of noodles over the sauce, then spread a layer of the ricotta mixture over the noodles. Add another layer of meat sauce, followed by a layer of mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers, finishing with a layer of noodles topped with meat sauce, mozzarella cheese, and grated Parmesan cheese.</li>

  <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes, or until cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
