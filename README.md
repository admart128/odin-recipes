A simple website completed as part of a free open source coding curriculum called "The Odin Project" (https://www.theodinproject.com/)

"Itâ€™s time to practice all of the HTML knowledge you have acquired. In this project, you are going to build a basic recipe website."

The purpose of this project was just to learn the very basics of HTML.
